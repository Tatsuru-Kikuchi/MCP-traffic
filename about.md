# About MCP Traffic

**MCP Traffic** (Model Control Protocol for Traffic) is a sophisticated data collection and analysis system designed specifically for monitoring Tokyo's transportation network. This project leverages the power of open data to provide insights into traffic patterns, transportation efficiency, and urban mobility trends.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a comprehensive, automated system that:

- **Democratizes Traffic Data**: Makes Tokyo traffic data accessible and understandable
- **Enables Research**: Provides researchers and analysts with high-quality transportation data
- **Supports Decision Making**: Offers insights that can inform transportation planning and policy
- **Promotes Open Data**: Demonstrates the value of open transportation data initiatives

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies

- **ODPT API**: Source of real-time Tokyo transportation data
- **Jekyll**: Static site generator for documentation and presentation
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration and deployment

### System Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Automated API polling
   - Rate limiting and error handling
   - Data validation and quality checks

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Raw data cleaning and normalization
   - Format conversion and standardization
   - Historical data archiving

3. **Monitoring Layer**

   - API documentation

## Data Sources

### ODPT API

The Open Data Platform for Transportation (ODPT) provides access to:

- **Real-time Train Information**: Delays, cancellations, service status
- **Bus Location Data**: Real-time bus positions and schedules
- **Station Information**: Facility data, accessibility information
- **Route Data**: Transportation network topology
- **Fare Information**: Pricing data for various transportation modes

### Data Types Collected

- **Static Data**: Station locations, route maps, facility information
- **Real-time Data**: Vehicle positions, delays, service disruptions
- **Schedule Data**: Timetables, planned services, maintenance windows
- **Operational Data**: Capacity information, accessibility status
