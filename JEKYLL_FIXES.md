# MCP Traffic - Jekyll Deployment Fixes

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This commit addresses several critical issues that were preventing the Jekyll site from deploying successfully to GitHub Pages:

### 1. Missing Navigation Files ✅
- **Added `contact.md`** - The Jekyll config referenced this file in navigation but it didn't exist
- **Added `docs/index.md`** - Documentation index page was missing

### 2. Gemfile Conflicts ✅
- **Simplified Gemfile** - Removed conflicting Jekyll version specifications
- **GitHub Pages compatibility** - Now uses only `github-pages` gem for consistency
- **Locked Ruby version** - Set to 3.3.0 for current GitHub Pages compatibility

### 3. Jekyll Configuration ✅
- **Simplified `_config.yml`** - Removed complex configurations that could cause build failures
- **Fixed URL structure** - Set proper base URL for GitHub Pages
- **Streamlined plugins** - Only essential plugins included

### 4. Ruby Version ✅
- **Updated `.ruby-version`** - Changed from 3.1.6 to 3.3.0 for better GitHub Actions compatibility

## Expected Results

The Jekyll site should now:
- ✅ Build successfully in GitHub Actions
- ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages without errors
- ✅ Have working navigation to all pages
- ✅ Use consistent gem versions

## Next Steps

1. The GitHub Actions workflow should automatically trigger on this push
2. Check the Actions tab to verify successful deployment
3. Visit `https://tatsuru-kikuchi.github.io/MCP-traffic` to see the live site

If there are still issues, they will be visible in the GitHub Actions logs and can be addressed individually.
